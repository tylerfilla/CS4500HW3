 *
 * FOREWORD: For my HW2 submission, I reused much code from my HW1 submission.
 * However, for my HW3 submission, I have decided to rewrite the program in an
 * attempt to apply what I have learned about Free Pascal since. In particular,
 * I tried to improve my encapsulation habits, preferring functions and records
 * to procedures and global state, respectively, and I tried to prefer
 * immutability where possible (e.g. using const references or pass-by-value).
 *
 * [ DESCRIPTION ]
 *
 * This program intends to implement the specified game and program behavior: A
 * strongly-connected digraph is drawn on an imaginary game board, and a marker
 * is randomly moved along the edges until all nodes have been visited. Each
 * node counts the number of times it has been visited, and some statistics are
 * produced after the game completes. This basic game is played three times on
 * boards defined in user-provided text files (the format of these files is
 * defined below, and some examples are provided, as well).
 *
 * [ INTERNALS ]
 *
 * As mentioned in the foreword, this program avoids global variables unlike my
 * my previous submissions. Multiple records are defined to facilitate operation
 * of the game: one record, TBoard, provides the game board; another,
 * TGameResults, tracks the statistics of one game; and another, TSeriesResults,
 * holds the results of all games played in a series. These records are
 * documented in more detail at their respective source code locations.
 *
 * I also simplified the internal representation of the circles and arrows.
 * Previously, I had declared a global dynamic array of circles, and I used the
 * SetLength function to allocate N circle records where each circle record
 * contained a dynamic array of pointers (representing arrows) to other circle
 * records (allocated in that same global array). In HW3, I instead chose a
 * cleaner method: I use a dynamic array of TCircle records in a TBoard record,
 * and each circle has a dynamic array of integer indices.
 *}

program HW3;

type
    {*
     * A circle.
     *}
    TCircle = record
        // Indices of target circles (outgoing arrows).
        arrows: array of integer;

        // The number of checkmarks placed on the circle.
        marks: integer;
    end;

    {*
     * A game board.
     *
     * This most closely represents one game input.
     *
     * A single TBoard record represents the state of a single game board. As
     * the game is played, the board state mutates.
     *}
    TBoard = record
        // The name of the source file from which the board was parsed.
        filename: string;

        // The number of circles on the board.
        numCircles: integer;

        // The number of arrows on the board.
        numArrows: integer;

        // The circles on the board.
        circles: array of TCircle;
    end;

    {*
     * Single game results.
     *
     * This most closely represents one game output.
     *
     * As a game is being played on a board defined by a TBoard record, the
     * PlayGame function collects gameplay statistics and results into one of
     * these records. Upon completion, the pair of records, one TBoard and one
     * TGameResults, together represent the game and its simulation.
     *}
    TGameResults = record
        // A copy of the source game board.
        board: TBoard;
    end;

    {*
     * Game series results.
     *
     * This most closely represents the final table.
     *
     * After a number of games have been played, and their respective
     * TGameResults records collected, the ComputeResults function may be used
     * to produce a TSeriesResults record containing the final statistics.
     *}
    TSeriesResults = record
        // pass
    end;

// Read a file and parse it for a game board
function ParseBoardFile(constref filename: string): TBoard;
var
    // The parsed board.
    board: TBoard = ();
begin
    board.filename := filename;

    // Return parsed board
    ParseBoardFile := board;
end;

// Play a single game on the given board
function PlayGame(board: TBoard): TGameResults;
var
    
    // The game results.
    results: TGameResults = ();
begin
    // Return game results
    PlayGame := results;
end;

// Crunch the numbers for the given games and compute series results
function ComputeResults(constref games: array of TGameResults): TSeriesResults;
var
    // The series results.
    results: TSeriesResults = ();
begin
    // Return series results
    ComputeResults := results;
end;

var
    // The series results.
    results: array of TGameResults;

begin
    WriteLn(ParseBoardFile('abcdef.txt').filename);
end.
